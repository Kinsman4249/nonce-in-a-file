# .github-private (template library)

Private home for **reusable community-health files and project templates**
that get copied into Kinsman4249's public projects.

If you are reading this inside a real project: someone forgot to delete
`_template/`. Delete this whole folder and the template index section of the
root `README.md` - see [../README.md](../README.md) for the exact marker.

## Why a separate private repo

GitHub natively supports a `.github` repo on user/org accounts that
automatically applies community-health files to all public repos. That's nice
in theory but couples every project to a single set of templates. Keeping
these as **canonical sources you copy from** rather than **defaults that
auto-apply** lets each project tweak its own templates (test commands,
supported versions, etc.) without diverging from the originals here.

## What lives here

```
.github-private/
|-- README.md                  project stub + delete-me template index (the hub)
|-- CHANGELOG.md               blank Keep a Changelog stub, ready to use
|-- RELEASE.md                 notes file: real changelog is _template/CHANGELOG.md
|-- CONTRIBUTING.md            placeholders intact
|-- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md         placeholders intact
|-- SECURITY.md                placeholders intact
|-- .gitignore
|-- .gitattributes             keeps _template/ and .github/ out of release zips
|-- .github/
|   |-- PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
|   |-- ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
|   |   |-- bug_report.md
|   |   `-- feature_request.md
|   `-- workflows/
|       `-- release.yml        THE workflow. One file. Ships everywhere.
`-- _template/                 <-- delete this folder to start a real project
    |-- README.md              this file: the full library index
    |-- CLAUDE.md              rules for maintaining this template library
    |-- PROJECT_CLAUDE.md      optional starter; rename to /CLAUDE.md in a real project
    |-- CHANGELOG.md           this library's own real history

## Using this repo

**Starting a new project?** Copy this whole repo (or use "Use this template"
on GitHub, once it is marked as a template repo), then:

1. Fill in the placeholders in the root `README.md` (`<PROJECT_NAME>`,
   `<REPO_URL>`, etc. - see [new-project.md](docs/new-project.md) for the full
   walkthrough).
2. Delete everything from the `TEMPLATE INDEX` marker down in the root
   `README.md`, and delete this `_template/` folder.
3. Optionally rename `_template/PROJECT_CLAUDE.md` to `/CLAUDE.md` if you want
   a starting set of Claude directives; otherwise it goes with the folder. If
   you keep it, delete everything from its `DELETE-ON-ADOPT` marker down - that
   part explains what belongs in the file and is not meant to be reloaded by
   every session in the repo. The `newproj` skill does this for you.

**Updating a community-health policy that should apply across all
projects?** Edit the canonical version here first, then open PRs to each
downstream public repo to bring them into sync.
